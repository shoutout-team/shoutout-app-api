# ShoutOut-API

This project provides an internal API for serving our SPA-Frontend.
- It acts as a REST-based service with endpoints for provision of all relevant data in JSON-format.
- This includes currently: members, companies and locations.
- It handles registration and login for new members and creating and updating a company-profile.
